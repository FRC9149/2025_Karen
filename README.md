# About Us

Out of River Falls High School, it's our 3rd year as a FIRST Robotics team, comprised of talented and innovative members. It's a thrilling journey where we get to design, build, and program our own robot to compete in exhilarating challenges.

Being a member of the RoboCats is not just about building robots; it's about building skills, friendships, and a lifelong appreciation for STEM disciplines. We can't wait to continue our adventure with FIRST and see where it takes us next!

The River Falls robotics team wishes all others an exciting and successful season.
